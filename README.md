## Project Setup and Execution

### Front-End (React)

1. Navigate to the frontend project folder:
   ```
   cd Front-End (React)
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

4. For production build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### Back-End (Node.js)

1. Navigate to the backend project folder:
   ```
   cd Back-End (Node.js)
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Express server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```
   The server will start running, typically on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (check console output for the exact port).

## Additional Setup Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before starting.
- The frontend and backend should be run simultaneously for full functionality.
- Check the `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories for any necessary environment variables.
- For database setup, refer to the `README.md` file in the backend directory.
